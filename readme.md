**Tell the Truth** can send messages about the climate crisis and environmental emergency to the world's biggest polluters.

The list of polluters is from the [**Carbon Disclosure Project's Carbon Majors Datasets (2017)**](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/66852db6305c26bc44feac8b8b9dfbaed7743f643b17c0d8d7008ae05894a00c/https%3A//www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/new-report-shows-just-100-companies-are-source-of-over-70-of-emissions).

The messages being sent are the key messages from [**UN Environmentâ€™s sixth Global Environment Outlook (2019)**](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/13658b41ee6482dcb919fd2284cc60e8a47de71a5c534e2c5dd7dded64678743/https%3A//www.unenvironment.org/resources/assessment/geo-6-key-messages).

The messages are sent as HTTP-requests with statements encoded in the query string of the URL, continuously, at a configurable rate which is clearly displayed and only as long as the add-on is switched on in the pop-up menu.
